A bunch of stuff that I normally like to have around, or that it isn't normal 
for me to have, but which I thought others would find useful.

  TopLJPostPackager.py       - Used at jrbl.org to query my LiveJournal, gather up the most recent public posts, and 
                               stick their permalinks into a file for server-side inclusion.  With minor enhancement,
                               could be used to repackage any RSS or Atom feed.

  BaseChanger.py             - converts integers into string representations in arbitrary bases, and arbitrarily-based
                               strings (encoding numeric values) into regular integers.  Has convenience features for 
                               bases up to base-66, which is the highest base that can be supported in standard URLs.
                               Used whenever I need to generate locally unique identifiers.

  git_diff_wrapper           - With many thanks to Jim Wierich.  A thin wrapper around vimdiff so that git can use 
                               it for 'git diff'.

Dotfiles: note these have been renamed; move to your home directory and remove the leading _ to install.
  _.bash_aliases             - shell functions and aliases I use every day
  _.bash_logout              - clears screen on logout
  _.bash_profile             - adjusts path and manpath and friends for /usr/local and ~/.user/
  _.bashrc                   - mostly just has colorful, wonderful prompts

  _.inputrc                  - configures keystrokes in all GNU readline-aware programs (bash, ipython, etc.)

  _.screenrc                 - contains comments explaining how to do screen sharing.  sort of.
  _.tmux.conf                - terminal sharing is much easier in tmux, so recently I've switched to it

  _.vimrc                    - Possibly the most important thing in skel
  _.vim/
    colors/
    plugin/
    syntax/
      javascript.vim         - the default coloration of javascript is *terrible*
    templates/
      *                      - various templates for use with Aristotle Pagaltiz's vim templates system
                               You have no idea how much I type :set ft=py
